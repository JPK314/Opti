# Opti
 Opti is a reinforcement learning agent that plays Rocket League. It does so by combining multiple trained models into one agent.
 The action space, obs, network size and shape, rewards, etc. are all different from KaiyoBumBot and my other bots.
 Opti comes from options (choices of model) and is also a familiar nickname for the Optimist class of sailboat.
 
 Plans for the sub-models are kickoff, pinches, aerial play (without pinches), general 1s/2s/3s play, and possibly others in the future.
